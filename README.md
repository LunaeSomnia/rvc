A Version Control software written in Rust.
This repository is created as a fun side project and it is not intended for general public use.

It is based on a challenge from the `Pro/g/ramming Challenges, v4.0` problem set, number 24, described as:

`Simple Version Control supporting checkout, commit (with commit messages), unlocking, and per-file configuration of number of revisions kept`.

If you feel like I could have improved something in this project, please let me know!
